I'm a candidate at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Biomedical AI](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai/people/doctoral-researchers) at the University of Edinburgh. I enjoy using Machine Learning to make things work better. Previously, I graduated with my first MSc from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin and did my undergraduate studies at the University of Oxford.
