Here's a small selection of projects that I have done.

[<span style="font-size:larger;">Controllability of Risk in Financial Networks</span>]()  
*MSc Seminar Network Games and Mechanism Design*  
Project description goes here. This is larger: smaller fontsize. The description could go on a while, I did X Y and Z but not W or Q.
