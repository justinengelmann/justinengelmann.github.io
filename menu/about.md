I'm a candidate at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Biomedical AI at the University of Edinburgh](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai/people/doctoral-researchers). I enjoy using Machine Learning to make things more efficient. Prior to this, I got an MSc in Business Administration from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin where I focussed on Machine Learning, Data Science and Operations Research. During my MSc, I worked at a student research assistant for computational statistics at the Chair of Statistics and interned at BCG and its data science branch, BCG GAMMA. For my undergraduate degree, I studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.

I'm currently in the MSc by Research year of the CDT programme and still exploring in which direction I want to take my research specifically. Here's some of the topics that currently interest me: Machine learning for structured (e.g. EHR) and unstructured (e.g. image) data; generative modelling for privacy-preserving data sharing and for resampling of biased or imbalanced datasets; learning from heterogeneous data sources; prescriptive modelling to optimise outcome-specific rather than technical metrics; explainable and causal machine learning. I'm also interested in the intersection of Ethics and AI.

If any of the above topics interest you or if you have a project idea that you would like to collaborate on, I would be delighted if you got in touch. Cheers!
