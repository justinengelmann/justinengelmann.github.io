I'm a candidate at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Biomedical AI at the University of Edinburgh](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai/people/doctoral-researchers). Prior to this, I got an MSc in Business Administration from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin where I focussed on Machine Learning, Data Science and Operations Research. During my MSc, I worked as a student research assistant for computational statistics at the Chair of Statistics and interned at BCG and its data science branch, BCG GAMMA. For my undergraduate degree, I studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.
