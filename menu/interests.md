I'm currently in the MSc by Research year of the CDT programme and still exploring in which direction I want to take my research specifically. I am always curious to hear from biomedical researchers and doctors what challenges they're facing that they would like to tackle with machine learning or quantitative methods more generally.

Here's some of the topics that currently interest me:  
- Machine learning for structured (e.g. EHR) and unstructured (e.g. image) data  
- Generative modelling for privacy-preserving data sharing and for resampling of biased or imbalanced datasets  
- Learning from heterogeneous data sources  
- Prescriptive modelling to optimise relevant outcome-specific rather than technical metrics  
- Explainable and causal machine learning

I'm also interested in the intersection of Ethics and AI, especially algorithmic fairness and privacy. For instance, I would like to investigate the tension between aggregate metrics and protection of relevant subgroups. I hope that I can offer a unique perspective as I originally planned to pursue postgraduate studies in philosophy after my Bachelor's and now do technical research in AI. I'm interested in both abstract, conceptual work in this space as well as developing new ML methods that take ethics into account.

If any of the above topics interest you or if you have a project idea, I would be delighted if you got in touch. Cheers!
